# Reinforcement learning in tetris 

This is based on https://github.com/benycze/python-tetris implementation of tetris under the GPL-3.0 license. For the course SSY340 Deep machine learning at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.
### Prerequisites

pygame

## Control


* *Arrows* - used for moving a block
* *Space*  - rotates the block
* *q*      - quit the game
* *p*      - pause the game

## Todo
* Bypass GUI to be able to run game headless (to save time during training)
* See over the reward funciton, currently not implemented in Tetris.game\_logic()
* Create neural network 
* Change user interface from keyboard to neural network (such that the NN is able to do actions)
